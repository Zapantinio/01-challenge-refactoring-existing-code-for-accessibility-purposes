# Challenge 1 - Refactoring existing code for accessibility purposes 

## Description
This is the 1st weekly challenge for UOB's Front End Developr and UX Bootcamp concerning accessibility. 
The codebase for a marketing agency's website is given and the purpose is to change it to follow accessibility standards and make it optimised for search engines.
The challenge is designed to prepare the developer for a scenario they will encounter in their career as a Front-End Software Engineer/Developer:

* On-the-job tickets or feature requests.

The challenge follows agile project management conventions where it provides a user story, acceptance criteria, a mock-up demonstrating the application's functionality, and review guidelines.
